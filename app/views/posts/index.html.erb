<%= render(@posts) || "There are no blog posts!" %>

<!-- Note: When dealing with an empty collection,
you'll need to use () to wrap that collection. -->

<!-- you will have a partial with the name of
the models in the collection. Rails will even
render a collection of heterogeneous models
([customer, order, customer]) calling the
correct partial for each one. -->

 <!-- the collection you pass to your render call
 is empty? If you don't handle this exception
 the render method will return nil and nothing
 will appear on the screen. A useful trick is
 to use the || operator to print something to
 the screen to alert the user to this. -->
